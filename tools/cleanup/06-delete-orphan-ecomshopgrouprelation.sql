-- 06-delete-orphan-ecomshopgrouprelation.sql — Delete the single orphan row
-- (ShopGroupShopId='SHOP19', ShopGroupGroupId='GROUP253') from
-- [EcomShopGroupRelation] in Swift 2.2. SHOP19 is not a valid ShopId
-- (only 9 shops exist: SHOP1/5/6/7/8/9/14/27/28). This orphan triggers the
-- FK re-enable escalation in SqlTableProvider on every deserialize.
-- Closes Phase 38 B.4 (D-38-08) / Phase 38.1 B.4.1 (D-38.1-05).
--
-- Re-runnable. Transaction-wrapped. Asserts expected count before DELETE.
