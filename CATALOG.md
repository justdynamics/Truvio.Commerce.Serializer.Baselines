# Catalog

Every published baseline, its tested platform version, and its status. Status
values: **Stable** (passed the clean-room round-trip gate, suitable for use),
**In progress** (being authored, not yet gated), **Deprecated** (superseded).

## Release tags

Each package is released independently with a `<product>/<semver>` tag, which
builds an Upload-ready `.zip` and attaches it to a GitHub Release:

- `swift/2.2.0`
- `digital-asset-portal/1.0.0`

The baseline version tracks the **source solution** version; the patch digit
bumps for content fixes within that solution version.
