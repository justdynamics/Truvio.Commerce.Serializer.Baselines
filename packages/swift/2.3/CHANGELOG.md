# Changelog — swift/2.3

All notable changes to the Swift 2.3 baseline. Versions track the source solution version;
the patch digit bumps for content fixes.

## 2.3.0

- Initial published baseline for Swift 2.3 on DW 10.26.9.
- Verified round-trip across three Swift platform releases (2.3.0, 2.2.0, 2.1.0) — deploy +
  seed deserialize HTTP 200, zero escalations, row/page parity (both language areas 123 pages,
  EcomProducts 2051), frontend smoke all-2xx.
- Deploy tree (18 predicates): Swift 2 content area + Customer Center groups + ecommerce
  reference tables (countries, currencies, languages, VAT, shops, payments, shipping, order
  state machine) + URL routing.
- Seed tree (19 predicates): customer-owned content subtrees (Homepage, Site chrome, About,
  Starter blog posts, Find dealers, footers, Newsletter examples) + starter catalog (groups,
  products, variants, discounts) + contract pricing.
- Includes the Dutch language layer (`Swift 2 Nederlands`).
- Config: `config/swift-2.3.json`.

## Changes from swift/2.2

- **Customer Center access control (Deploy — 1 new predicate):** added `Customer center user
  groups` Deploy predicate (`AccessUser` rows with `AccessUserType = 2` for the `Customers`,
  `Account Admin`, and `CSR` groups). Customer Center pages carry inline page-permission
  bindings that resolve against these groups on deserialize and write the access gate into
  `UnifiedPermission`, so the Customer Center is only accessible to authenticated members of
  the appropriate group.
- **Contract pricing (Seed — 1 new predicate):** added `Demo contract pricing` Seed predicate
  (`EcomPrices` rows scoped by `PriceUserCustomerNumber`). Demonstrates customer-specific
  contract pricing through the standard DW 10 price resolver without custom code.
- **DW platform version:** bumped from DW 10.26.7 (swift/2.2) to DW 10.26.9 (swift/2.3).
- **Predicate count:** 17 Deploy + 18 Seed (swift/2.2) → 18 Deploy + 19 Seed (swift/2.3).
