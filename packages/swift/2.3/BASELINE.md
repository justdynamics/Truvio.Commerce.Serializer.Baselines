# Swift 2.3 baseline

**Solution:** Swift storefront (B2C/B2B commerce)
**Baseline version:** 2.3.0
**Captured & verified against:** DW 10.26.9
**Languages:** English (`Swift 2`) + Dutch language layer (`Swift 2 Nederlands`)
**Config:** [`config/swift-2.3.json`](config/swift-2.3.json)
**Engine:** Truvio.Commerce.Serializer v0.6.8-beta (min DW 10.23.9)
**Round-trip:** verified across Swift 2.3.0, 2.2.0, and 2.1.0 on DW 10.26.9 — deploy + seed
deserialize into a clean database return HTTP 200 with zero escalations; both language areas
round-trip page-for-page (123 each); `EcomProducts` (2051), `EcomGroups` (316), and
`EcomCountries` (96) match source; frontend smoke renders all pages 2xx.

When a customer adopts Swift as their commerce platform they get a working storefront before
adding a single product: hundreds of structural pages, item-type definitions, shop setup,
payment and shipping definitions, country/currency/VAT reference data, the order state machine,
URL-rewriting infrastructure, and a ready-to-use Customer Center with access control for buyer,
account-admin, and CSR roles. This package captures exactly that starting point so a clean install
can be brought to a known-good state and kept in sync across environments.

## The three buckets

Every piece of data in Swift belongs to one of three buckets. Only the first two are in this
package.

| Bucket | Owner | Behavior on deploy | In package |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Deploy** | Developer / template | Source wins — YAML overwrites the target every time | `deploy/` |
| **Seed** | Developer once, then the customer | Field-level merge — fills only empty fields, preserves customer edits | `seed/` |
| **Not-serialized** | Ops / infrastructure | Never captured; configured per environment | — |

## Deploy (`deploy/`) — 18 predicates

Structural, source-owned data that must be identical across dev/test/QA/prod.

- **Content — Swift 2 area:** the full page tree, item types, layouts, navigation, and framework
  pages (Customer Center, checkout, account, etc.), including inline page-permission bindings on
  Customer Center pages.
- **Customer Center groups:** three standard `AccessUser` rows (`Customers`, `Account Admin`,
  `CSR`) with `AccessUserType = 2`. Page-permission bindings in the Content predicate resolve
  against these groups on deserialize and write the access gate into `UnifiedPermission`, so
  Customer Center pages are only accessible to authenticated members of the appropriate group.
- **Ecommerce reference tables:** `EcomCountries`, `EcomCountryText`, `EcomCurrencies`,
  `EcomLanguages`, `EcomVatGroups`, `EcomVatCountryRelations`, `EcomShops`,
  `EcomShopLanguageRelation`, `EcomShopGroupRelation`, `EcomPayments`, `EcomShippings`,
  `EcomMethodCountryRelation`, `EcomOrderFlow`, `EcomOrderStates`, `EcomOrderStateRules`.
- **Routing:** `UrlPath`.

## Seed (`seed/`) — 19 predicates

Bootstrap content delivered once, then owned by the customer. Deserialize fills only fields the
target left empty, so customer edits survive re-runs.

- **Content subtrees** (one predicate each): Homepage, Homepage (machines), Site chrome
  (header/footer), About pages, Starter blog posts, Find dealers, Footer: about the shop,
  Footer: help and info, Newsletter examples (light), Newsletter examples (dark).
- **Catalog & promotions:** `EcomGroups`, `EcomProducts`, `EcomGroupProductRelation`,
  `EcomVariantGroups`, `EcomVariantsOptions`, `EcomVariantOptionsProductRelation`,
  `EcomDiscount`, `EcomDiscountTranslation`.
- **Contract pricing:** `EcomPrices` rows scoped by customer number
  (`PriceUserCustomerNumber`) — demonstrates customer-specific contract pricing through the
  standard DW 10 price resolver. No custom code is required.

## Not-serialized (configured per environment)

These never appear in any YAML and must be set on each target host:

- Live domain bindings (`AreaDomain`, `AreaDomainLock`) and CDN host.
- Payment-gateway API keys and other secrets (host configuration / key vault).
- Analytics and tag-manager IDs (e.g. `GoogleTagManagerID`), favicon overrides.
- The Swift template filesystem under `/Files/Templates/Designs/Swift/` (shipped with the
  design, cloned separately, not part of the data baseline).
- Customer user accounts, orders, and other operational data — configured per environment.

The config's `excludeXmlElementsByType` strips per-environment and transient fields out of
serialized XML payloads so they do not leak into the baseline.

## Deploying this package

- **CI/CD:** see [docs/consuming-cicd.md](../../../docs/consuming-cicd.md).
- **In-admin upload:** see [docs/consuming-upload.md](../../../docs/consuming-upload.md).

Deploy onto a host running the tested platform version (see
[COMPATIBILITY.md](../../../COMPATIBILITY.md)) for a deployment with no schema warnings.
The Customer Center groups predicate requires DW 10.23.9 or later (minimum engine version for
the `Where` clause support on `SqlTable` predicates).
